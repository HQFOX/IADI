Each one of this user story was satisfied both in mockup and IFML models.

## Concept models

Figure 1 represents the home page of the online Grant System, here the anonymous user can search for one of the grants displayed.

!["Homepage"](mockup_homepage.png)<br>
*Figure 1: Homepage Mockup*

In the list of grant calls is also possible to see right away the number of applications for each grant call.
The process of selection is simplified using the filter component shown in the Figure 2. This allows the user to quickly find the grant hes looking for like open/closed grants or funding value. The searchbar will also allow the user to quickly find something hes looking for in any columns.
After selecting a grant call, the details of that grant call is displayed like shown in the Figure 2.

!["Filter Component"](mockup_filter.png)<br>
*Figure 2: Filter component Mockup*

After the user found the desired grant, is possible to select it and check the full details like shown in the Figure 3.

!["Grant Details"](mockup_grantdetails.png)<br>
*Figure 3: Grant Details Mockup*

At Figure 3 is possible to see the full details of a grant call (such as description, open and close dates, funding value and the requirements for application). Here is also possible to see the applications for such grant.

The procedure described in the figures 1,2 and 3 is represented in IFML as shown in the Figure 4. Once the user selects a grant from GrantList a navigation event is produced, and as a result, the full details of the selected grant are displayed.

!["HomePage Details"](ifml_homepage_details.png)<br>
*Figure 4: IFML model corresponding to the display of the details of grant*

>[1] Selected Grant Call -> id <br>
[2] User -> user ; Password -> password <br>

Is also possible to see some user interaction with Login Form. This is a modal window where the user can write his credentials shown in the Figure 6.

!["HomePage Login Form"](mockup_loginmodal.png)<br>
*Figure 6: Login Modal Window*

After submit the form the system tries to authenticate the user and assign a role for that credentials received. In case of success a Modeless message, shown in the Figure 7, is displayed informing the user that hes now logged in.

!["HomePage Logged In"](mockup_loggedinmodeless.png)<br>
*Figure 7: Modeless logged in message*

After the user is authenticated, some pages adapt to the role displaying more information or options than normally is shown, for example, majority of the pages shown on the right top corner the user role and name like shown in Figure 8.

![HomePage logged in user"](mockup_homepage_loggedin.png)<br>
*Figure 8: Homepage with authenticated user*

In case of the authenticated user being a student, after select a open grant call and accessing the details, is possible to see a create button for a new Grant Application like shown in the Figure 9.

!["Grant Details"](mockup_grantdetails_student.png)<br>
*Figure 9: New Application button at Grant Details with authenticated role of Student*


After the New Application button is pressed the user is presented with a modal with a form containing the required fields.

![Grant Application Form"](grantApplicationModalForm.png)<br>
*Figure 10: Homepage with authenticated user*

when the user has filled the required fields he can submit the Submit button to submit the application , this will then show a confirmation or error message, if it was not possible to submit.
This message will show in a modal form as described in the next images.

![Successfully submitted modal"](grantApplicationModalSuccess.png)<br>
*Figure 11: Success message displayed when the application is successfully submitted*

![Error in submission modal"](grantApplicationModalError.png)<br>
*Figure 12: Error message displayed when an error occurs in the submission*

If the user does not submit and instead closes this form , it will later be accessible through  the Student Applications page,
available under the 'My profile' dropdown menu on the header

![MyProfile dropdown menu"](profileDropDown.png)<br>
*Figure 13: my profile dropdown menu for a student account*

![Student Applications Page"](studentApplicationsPage.png)<br>
*Figure 13: student applications page*

In this page the Student can see his current applications and by selecting one of them , the Grant Application form will appear, in the form of a modal as before, and the student can now resume filling the required items and submit.<br>
Once the application is submitted it will appear on the 'Submitted Grant Call Applications' list .
If the user selects one of these a new modal with appear with the grant call details , the submitted items and the evaluations divided by reviewer name.
The bottom will also show the status of this application

![Student Grant Calls page"](grantApplicationModalSubmitted.png)<br>
*Figure 14: submitted grant applications modal*

These procedures corresponding to the user as a student can also be described with the following IFML:
![Student Stories IFML diagram"](ifml_student.png)<br>
*Figure 15: IFML model representing student application progress*

>[1] Selected Grant Call -> id <br>
[2] Grant Call Title -> Confirmation Message <br>
[3] Grant Call Id -> GrantCallId <br>
[4] Error -> Error Message <br>
[5] Grant Application Id -> Grant Application Id <br>
[6] Selected Grant Application  -> Grant Application Id <br>
[7] Error -> Error Message <br>
[8] Error -> Field Error Message<br>
[9] Selected Grant Application -> id <br>
[10] Selected Review -> id <br>


After the user is logged in and authenticated as a reviewer (process shown in the Figure 4), is possible to access new options located at the top navigation bar like shown in Figure 15.

!["Nav bar Reviewer"](mockup_topbar_reviewer.png)<br>
*Figure 15: Top navigation bar with authenticated role of reviewer*

Using this menu, the user can access Grant Applications Assigned where can be seen the list of grant applications assigned to the panels that the reviewer belongs allowing the user to easily search for a specific grant, clicking on one grant will update the list of the right with the corresponding applications of the clicked grant. This page will dynamically update when the user click in the row of any data table. Again clicking in one of the available applications will display the corresponding data like application details, data items, reviews and the student information that submitted such application like shown in Figure 16.

!["Application details"](mockup_applications_reviewer.png)<br>
*Figure 16: Application details mockup*

The reviewer can then write a review using the button "Write New Review" where a modal dialog will ask for details about the review shown in the Figure 17.

!["Reviewer add review process"](mockup_applications_reviewer_addreview.png)<br>
*Figure 17: New review modal dialog mockup*

Being a chair of a panel the user can access the option in homepage called 'Chair Panel Review', this leads to a similar page of the written reviews shown in the Figure 18.

!["Chair panel review page"](mockup_applications_chair.png)<br>
*Figure 18: Grants where reviewer is chair panel of*

Using the button located on the bottom part called 'Close Application' is possible to the chair leader close the reviewing process and write a final review and evaluation of the student application. Using the button shows a modal window as shown in the 19 106.

!["Chair panel write final review"](mockup_applications_chair_writefinal.png)<br>
*Figure 19: Panel chair write final review and evaluation mockup*

This whole process is displayed in the Figure 20, where using XOR operand allows to define if in-page the reviewer wants to see the grants where he is a panel member or a panel chair. Using some in-page lists the user navigate to the application desired, read the reviews of the other panel members and finally close it leaving a review and final evaluation.
